# mean-monotonic-process
The code of this repository was used to generate the figures in the paper [Uniform mean estimation for monotonic processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01244).

`confidence_bands_examples.py` was used to generate Figure 1.  
`comparison_with_HW22.py` was used to generate Figure 2.

(Note that the data set sizes in the current version of the code might vary compared to those used for the figures displayed in the paper.)
